## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The "Lights Out" puzzle is a classic logic problem presented on a two-dimensional grid, typically of size *n x n*. Each cell in the grid represents a light that can exist in one of two discrete states: 'on' or 'off'.

The fundamental rule of the puzzle is that interacting with any single light toggles the state of both that light and its **orthogonal neighbors** (the cells directly above, below, left, and right). Given an initial, random configuration of lights, the objective is to determine a sequence of interactions that will transition all lights to the 'off' state.

This project implements several classical AI search algorithms to find the solution and provides a comparative analysis of their performance and efficiency in navigating the puzzle's state space.

## âœ¨ Algorithms Implemented

This repository includes the following search algorithms:

* **Uninformed Search:**
    * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    * Depth-First Search (DFS)
    * Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
* **Informed (Heuristic) Search:**
    * A\* Search
    * Weighted A\* Search

Several custom heuristics were designed and tested for the A\* algorithm to analyze their impact on performance.
